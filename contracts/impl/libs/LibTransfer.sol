     * @dev This internal function is equivalent to {safeTransferFrom}, and can be used to e.g. implement alternative
     *  mechanisms to perform token transfer, such as signature-based.

     *
     *  - `from` cannot be the zero address.
     *  - `to` cannot be the zero address.
     *  - `tokenId` token must exist and be owned by `from`.
     *  - If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received}, which is called upon a safe transfer.
     * @dev Emits a {Transfer} event.
     * @param from Address of the account currently owning the given token
     * @param to Address to transfer the token to
     * @param tokenId ID of the token to transfer
     * @param data Additional data with no specified format, sent in call to `to`
